Project Name: Travel Planner

Project Overview:
This is a serverless architecture full-stack travel planning application. It integrates AWS cloud services, relational databases, and large language models (LLM) to help users generate multi-day travel itineraries based on preferences, weather information, and uploaded ticket information.

Key Features:
• Personalized travel recommendations based on user preferences
• Dynamic itinerary adjustments using real-time weather data
• Flight status monitoring with delay/cancellation notifications 
• PDF/image ticket processing to extract departure locations, times, and other key information
• Secure authentication using AWS Cognito
• User and trip data storage in AWS Aurora MySQL database
• Google Maps integration for route planning and visualization
• Image storage and retrieval via AWS S3 for trip destinations
• Mobile-responsive frontend with dark mode support

Technologies Used:
• Frontend: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, responsive design with custom themes
• Backend: Python (running on AWS Lambda), API Gateway, MySQL (Aurora)
• Route Planning: Google Maps APIs for location search, routing, and visualization
• Weather & Flight APIs: Integration with aviation and weather data providers
• AI Engine: OpenAI multi-modal models for recommendations
• Cloud Infrastructure: AWS Lambda, S3, RDS Aurora, API Gateway, SQS, SES

System Architecture:
The frontend (HTML/JS/CSS) is deployed on S3 and communicates with the backend via API Gateway. The Gateway routes requests to various Lambda functions, which connect to the Aurora MySQL database and/or external APIs (OpenAI, weather API, flight API). For asynchronous tasks like email notifications, SQS is used as a message queue.

Deployment Steps:
1. Clone the code repository
2. Configure environment variables (database credentials, API keys, etc.)
3. Deploy Lambda functions using AWS SAM or CloudFormation
4. Build the frontend and upload to S3 with website hosting enabled
5. Configure CloudWatch triggers for scheduled Lambda functions (weather updates, flight checks)
6. Set up API Gateway with proper CORS and authentication settings
7. Configure SQS queues and SES for email notifications

Project Directory Structure:
• Lambda/: AWS Lambda functions organized by functionality
  - User management (registration, preferences, profiles)
  - Trip management (creation, editing, cloning, deletion)
  - Data processing (weather reports, flight status)
  - Notification services (email sending)
• Frontend/: Web client interface
  - utils/: Shared JS, CSS, and theme files
  - pages/: Main application pages and views
  - dashboard/: User dashboard components
  - trip_card/: Trip visualization and management
• Database/: SQL schema definitions and migrations

CI/CD Overview:
• AWS SAM/CloudFormation for infrastructure automation
• GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
• S3 bucket versioning for frontend rollback capability
